# Transportation-System
1 Introduction
Transportation system is always a concern wherever you go. It is a complicated system with various subsystems,
sometimes does not connect. Building applications that help people find the optimal route for traveling is an
important task in a smart city. In this assignment, the student will build an application to manage the subway
system of the cities. Below is a part of Tokyo transportation system
The student should perform a deep analysis of problem requirements before start implementing. Also, the
student is encouraged to follow the problem-solving process to do well in the assignment. In this assignment,
the student must design the data structure and utilize them in the project with the highest performance. The
linked list is the target data structure in this assignment. The student must implement the required features
using only this data structure with no additional libraries. All required libraries have been included in the initial
code. The detailed requirements are given in the next section.
